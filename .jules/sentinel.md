## 2024-05-15 - [Overly Permissive CORS Configuration and Error Leakage]
**Vulnerability:** The application was using an overly permissive CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration in `backend/main.py`. The `allow_origins=["*"]` allows any website to make requests to this backend when `allow_credentials=True` is also set. Additionally, HTTP 500 error responses were returning stringified internal exception details, which leaks sensitive information.
**Learning:** It's important to set specific origins for CORS when credentials are allowed, and to mask sensitive stack traces and internal errors in production APIs.
**Prevention:** Always use specific origins for CORS instead of the wildcard character (*), especially when allowing credentials. Always fail securely with generic error messages.
## 2026-08-02 - [Error Leakage from Exception stringification]
**Vulnerability:** HTTP 400 error responses were returning stringified internal exception details during file parsing and JSON loading in `backend/main.py`. This exposes internal execution flow, and specific errors to the client.
**Learning:** Returning `str(e)` in an API error response exposes details that malicious users can exploit.
**Prevention:** Mask specific errors behind a generic user-friendly string error message for failed validations.
## 2024-05-16 - [Missing Security Headers for Defense in Depth]
**Vulnerability:** The application was missing essential security HTTP headers (such as `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `Strict-Transport-Security`), leaving it potentially exposed to clickjacking, MIME-sniffing, and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
**Learning:** Security headers are a fundamental defense-in-depth measure that should be applied to all FastAPI endpoints to reduce the attack surface.
**Prevention:** Implement a global security middleware (`@app.middleware("http")`) that injects standard security headers into all outgoing API responses.
## 2024-10-27 - [Missing Authentication on Admin API Endpoints]
**Vulnerability:** The `/api/tickers` and `/api/tickers/sync` endpoints modified global application state (the backend JSON ticker database) but lacked any authentication or authorization checks. This allowed any unauthenticated user to overwrite the primary ticker dataset used for macro recommendations.
**Learning:** Endpoints that modify application state or configuration (admin endpoints) must always be protected with authentication to prevent unauthorized tampering.
**Prevention:** Implement mandatory token-based authentication (like an `X-Admin-Token` header validated against a secure environment variable) on all endpoints that modify global datasets or configurations. Use `hmac.compare_digest` to prevent timing attacks.
## 2024-11-20 - [Missing API Rate Limiting leading to DoS Vulnerability]
**Vulnerability:** The application was missing global rate limiting, allowing any IP to make unlimited requests to the API, which could lead to resource exhaustion and Denial of Service (DoS).
**Learning:** In-memory rate limiting implementations must strictly limit both the number of tracked IPs (using LRU eviction) and track `request.client.host` to prevent DoS by memory exhaustion or IP spoofing. Additionally, `RateLimitMiddleware` must be registered *before* `CORSMiddleware` in FastAPI so that early 429 response objects correctly receive CORS headers.
**Prevention:** Always implement bounded rate limiting on exposed APIs using an IP-based tracking strategy combined with LRU eviction mechanisms to protect server resources safely.
